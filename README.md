# STM32F756ZG-Bare-Metal-Driver-Development
Developing peripheral drivers for the STM32F756ZG using direct register-level programming without HAL. This project focuses on understanding ARM Cortex-M7 architecture, memory mapping, bus structure, RCC clock control, and low-level hardware interaction using embedded C.
