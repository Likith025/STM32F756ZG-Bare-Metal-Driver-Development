# STM32F756ZG Bare-Metal Driver Development

A comprehensive collection of peripheral drivers for the STM32F756ZG microcontroller, developed from the ground up using direct register-level programming. This project builds a strong foundation in embedded firmware development by working at the hardware level without relying on STM32 HAL or middleware libraries.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Master ARM Cortex-M7 architecture fundamentals
- Understand STM32F7 memory organization (Flash, DTCM, SRAM1, SRAM2)
- Implement accurate register structures based on RM0385 reference manual
- Master peripheral clock control using RCC
- Perform safe and deterministic bit-level register manipulation
- Build clean, reusable, and modular driver abstractions
- Develop production-quality embedded firmware patterns

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Philosophy

This project emphasizes:

- **Hardware Awareness**: Deep understanding of Cortex-M memory model
- **Bus Architecture**: Working with AHB and APB bus protocols
- **Clock Management**: Proper peripheral clock gating and RCC configuration
- **Register Safety**: Correct use of `volatile` for hardware registers and proper offset alignment
- **Clean Code**: Minimal abstraction overhead with modular, scalable driver structure
- **Verification**: All register structures verified against STM32F7 reference manual (RM0385)

## 📋 Design Principles

✓ **No HAL/Middleware**: Pure register-level implementation  
✓ **Minimal Abstraction**: Direct hardware control with clean macros  
✓ **Deterministic Behavior**: Predictable register access patterns  
✓ **Modular Structure**: Reusable and scalable driver architecture  
✓ **Production Ready**: Follows embedded systems best practices
